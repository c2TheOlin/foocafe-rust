Cargo

 --> Cargo is the default build system and package mananger for Rust, just like nuget, npm

Scaffolds projects -> git repo.

Downloads and builds dependencies.

--> TOML File

Where its stored you.

--> Key commands (same for all OS's)

Cargo new {{project name}}
Cargo build
Cargo check
Cargo run

Building is smart and doest re-build dependencies on changed code.

Continuing the analogy...

--> Crates

Two types binary Crates 
- Binary (such as a project)
- Library (re-usable code for sharing)

Libraries should contain docs
carg doc --open will build a local doc folder for your project
including docs for dependencies which is browsable. 

Sharable crates exist on https://crates.io/

--> Cargo update 
Ensure thats only explicit package changes happen by using cargo.lock
Only updates patch versions

Uses document comments for adding crate information

module system, and include:

Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module
